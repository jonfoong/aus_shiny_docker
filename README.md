# aus_shiny_docker

The scraper is separated from the shiny app to reduce runtime. Scraper is containerised and executed via a GCP virtual machine twice daily. Container image at https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jonfoong/aus_shiny

Shiny link:  https://jonfoong.shinyapps.io/ausdashboard/

The scraper is no longer regularly maintained, though the Shiny link should still work. If data on Shiny link is not updated please open an issue.
